## Demo:
0. Make sure you installed all the dependencies: ```$ npm install```
1. ```$ npm start``` and then open your browser on [localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000/)
2. authentication: we use local storage to store the token. We'll learn about cookies in the next project.

## Contributing:
1. clone this repo.
2. In your terminal, type: ```$ npm install```
3. install commitizen globally and use it to format your commit. (Please note that commitizen is already saved in the package.json so it will already be installed locally.)
4. Please follow [these instructions](https://www.npmjs.com/package/commitizen#conventional-commit-messages-as-a-global-utility) to set commitizen to use the **cz-conventional-changelog**.
5. The first time you work on a branch: ```git checkout -b <userstory>``` After that, just ```git checkout <userstory>``` When creating a branch, make sure you know the names of the branches to use. Check with your team!
6. ```git pull origin <userstory>`` to retrieve any change from that branch.
7. Make your modifications
8. Add them, and then commit them with: ```git cz```
